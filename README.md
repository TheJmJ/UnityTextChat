**_READ ME FIRST_**

This is a simple Chat utilizing Unity as the client and SDLNet on the server

We also have fancy features such as /nick for nickname changes and... that's about it!

To start up the chat:
- Start the Server
- Boot up at least 2 Clients
- If locally hosted server, type in localhost
- Press ENTER to connect. SEND doesn't work
